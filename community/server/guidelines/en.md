## A Brief History

> Go to the [Server Constitution](/community/server/constitution).

> There are some ideas not implemented yet for the staff guidelines. These ideas include manager roles, removal of the staff hierarchy, and the democratic discussion system. These ideas will be discussed further for finalization.
{: .disclaimer }

The Staff Guidelines were implemented for a general view of
guidance, advice, and quality assurance. Parts One and Two of these
guidelines were written and established on October 24, 2022. Since
then, users have had concerns regarding our decisions and stances
in particular situations. As a result, the Staff Guidelines were
made public on July 25, 2023, as evidenced by this document you're
reading. All staff decisions are based on these guidelines. While
we attempt to have high moderation standards, we sometimes make
mistakes.

Following these guidelines helps avoid mistakes in the future. If
not, the guidelines are updated to resolve mistakes we have made
in the past.

Any significant instance of drama, discussion, and feedback is considered when writing these guidelines. If you would like to be a part of the staff team, you must follow these guidelines to a degree. If you would like to contribute, that's great! Leave your feedback in [#ðŸ’¡server-direction](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1034240760154947584) where it will be considered. Have fun reading~

### For New Staff

- Introduce yourself to the existing staff.
- Describe why you wanted to become a staff member.
- Don't be afraid to ask - you only learn if you ask!
- Understand the server rules. Going back and referring to them won't hurt!
- We strive for continuous improvement. Regularly evaluate and enhance community processes for efficiency. Provide constructive feedback to peers for personal and team growth.

## Team Philosophy

> A reminder that anything said in the staff chats is to be kept in the staff chats unless stated otherwise by an Admin. Failure to do so will lead to demotion.
{: .caution }
> All staff must engage with server members, contribute, or document activities to help maintain a healthy community.

### The Vow of Thought

The idea social hierarchy should not be of any significance. The staff team is expected to act as normal members and refrain from giving themselves the benefit over the common member but rather connect with them to establish common values. The goal is not to establish equality but to establish the idea of the common "Camellian", in which they all have the same thoughts of liberty, fairness, and professionalism. Do not disregard authority but instead treat yourself as a common member.

A staff member must be open to the idea of leniency as we shall strive to support free speech regardless of background to discuss our thoughts. This is so we are presented with different ideas. This does not mean endorsing the ideas of prejudice and immorality but being mindful that worldviews differ for each individual. It will allow us to educate individuals who may establish themselves as ignorant. We should stay curious and provide the education needed for any topic discussed or be educated when presented with unknowingness or uncertainty. We must have a curious mind for learning because we donâ€™t want to be ignorant of our decisions. If someone were to be punished or scrutinized for something unclear, we would not use gossip, accusations, or different platforms to validate our choices. Instead, we should know most about a situation to balance objective and emotional thought.

We are expected to be rational and thoughtful staff members who show compassion and understanding rather than thinking, "Rules are rules, so we are here to follow them." This doesn't mean disregarding order but being mindful of how we act when punishing those deserving. We favor confrontation and communication instead of building up our issues personally or within a group. We should not be afraid of voicing our thoughts to someone scrutinizing us, as there will be no improvement if no concerns are made clear to the perpetrator. Snarky, negative comments shall be prohibited outside of the staff channels and kept to oneself unless this negativity is constructive, objective, or banter.

We must be open to trying foreign ideas for continuous improvement. The average member providing odd ideas could sometimes be called "unpopular" or "irrelevant." While opposition is met with these odd ideas, staff members should think curiously when approaching them. Experimentation with approaches may be considered for the progression of the community, as these experiments can be seen as Discord's experiments. For the sake of improvement and a creative mind, we shall experiment with what we have and develop something unique to benefit the members. Members will get frustrated with change regardless, as seen during the server overhaul in 2022. However, this is opposed since progression can help the average member. Feedback is also given through experimentation and should be appreciated.

### Behavioral Guidelines

> A staff member must not place their peers under scrutiny as this will lead to friction. Instead, staff members are preferred to confront the problem and resolve it civilly. Do not endorse buildup!
{: .disclaimer }

1. Try to be nice. This place is supposed to welcome everyone regardless of who they are and their worldview.
1. Be open to the idea of leniency. We strive to support free speech regardless of backgrounds to discuss our thoughts.
1. Encourage discussion to be engaged in an open-minded manner. Take a step back from personal beliefs and opinions and argue reasonably. Learn to educate rather than win.
1. Try not to be an arbitrary person or make arbitrary decisions in a situation; doing this is unfair.
1. Try not to be arrogant and avoid brown-nosing. This makes you look stupid and does not fall within the standard of the staff team. Remind yourself that we are all one!
1. You are expected to be cool. (Be cool!)

### Core Guidelines

> Contact another staff member if you're feeling burnt out and/or
you need help with moderating. The staff team looks for
consistent contribution, not overloaded.
{: .disclaimer }

1. You are expected not to take server rules and guidelines lightly. You are below the staff guidelines and the server rules (more below than members). Remember, you have a significant influence on members and outsiders.
1. You are expected to know basic bot commands for dishing punishment or posting FAQs. For using John Wick, basic commands are !warn !timeout add !purge and !kick. Read #mod-commands for more documentation.
1. You are expected to approach situations with a curious mind. Get to know everything about the situation to balance objective and emotional thought.
1. You are expected to be mindful of advice from peers. If you make a mistake, don't regret it. Take accountability and learn from it.
1. Political/religious talk is not allowed on the main channels.
This server has many people with differing opinions. If anyone
is talking about political situations, redirect them to
[#serious-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1080971258272948265). If anyone is hateful toward a marginalized group,
please use the FAQ commands on bigotry (?bigot) or punish them accordingly.

## Guidance of Order

### Punishment Template

The template for punishing someone is *VERBAL WARNING -> INFRACTION/WARNING -> TEMPMUTE -> KICK -> 8-DAY BAN -> INDEF BAN.* The template may vary based on staff discretion. Staff members are required to use good judgment when offering punishment. If staff members cannot decide on a consensus for a member, a verbal warning will be given by default.

### Disciplinary actions

When people don't listen, you need to take action. Here's how to make yourself look less 1984 and more like Mad Max (a more respected kind of staff member).

1. Try to mention your actions and anything relevant regarding a
particular member, events, and/or punishments within the staff channels. This is clarity's sake.
1. Listen to the room in certain situations. If a sensitive topic arises, you must address it and diverge from it. Only in extreme cases should sensitive topics be forcefully shifted.
1. Always put a reason for anything. This includes warnings, bans, and kicks.
1. If members have questions about a punishment, you must address it as you see fit (privately is preferred). If you choose to, try to make messages short and straightforward on why they were punished.
1. If someone complains about their punishment not being listed in the rules, remind them about reading the room and what we interpret from the room that was presented to us.
1. If someone doesn't listen after an infraction, time them out.

### Cross-Banning users

In extreme circumstances, we may ban individuals for their actions in other communities even if they have not breached any rules in this server. This will only happen if all of the following conditions are met.

1. The user has broken Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
1. The Admins are confident of any evidence sent regarding such behavior of the user.
1. The user is in the server and poses a safety risk for other members.

## Advice

### Communication

1. Have the goal of maintaining communication with community members. Nobody wants to listen to a mod who never speaks, right?
1. Address community concerns and donâ€™t engage in unneeded arguments or discussions. Work towards solutions!
1. Update staff and members of implemented server changes. You may announce them in community updates or server updates.
1. Use server direction pings if you are unsure of a change or have questions for the community to answer. You may announce within the server direction channel or community updates.
1. Regularly check the staff chat to see what's going on!
1. Listen to what people say and connect with them. Try to be patient with them so they can feel comfortable with whatâ€™s happening. By doing this method, it should be easier to diverge a heated topic/discussion and talk about something else.

### Gray areas

We will consider specific content as a punishable offense when:

1. The posted content is illegal (i.e., drugs, piracy).
1. The user or content bears bigotry and/or hate (such as profiles, bios, or nicknames).
1. The content being posted violates Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
1. The content being posted implies anything that breaks the server constitution/rules maliciously.

### Events and Announcements

If you have any ideas or experiments to try yourself, please do so! However, the general idea of event hosting should be as follows. Please note each event contribution you've made (or fill out a contribution form!). This is for documentation's sake!

Always use [this channel](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1251343238237917205) for anonymous announcements. Your messages will be reposted by a bot.

If you need an idea of where to create events. Scroll to the top of the channel list and locate the Event Button. You can see a screenshot example below.

![Click the Event Button!](/assets/images/staffGuidelines/eventstuf.png)
{: .centerItem }

#### Events: Hosting Requirements

- Make sure events are organized and planned. Be sure you are appealing to community interests.
- Promote and participate in the event you're hosting. This is to get community members interested in them.
- Make events easy to participate in and as welcoming as possible. The goal is to create retention!

#### Events: Camellia Orientated

When Camellia does something awesome, it is preferred to create a Discord event so it can be marked in the calendar. There should be an image demonstrating how to create Discord events above.

When making events about Camellia, you should keep an eye out for these.

- Camellia song premieres (on his YouTube channel)
- Camellia DJ sets/events
- Music fests featuring Camellia (VRChat, Comiket, etc.)
- Anything involving Camellia!

#### Announcements: Tone of delivery

- Professional posts must be neutral to the reader. No bias should show or any favoring to certain topics. Only on rare occasions should this rule be voided.
- Grammar and styling should be consistent with previous posts. When creating a post, be sure to check grammar with built-in text editors.
- Posts must be easy to digest and understandable for readers. Be sure to avoid any complex or abrupt sentences.
- Be sure to preview your posts in any of the staff chats before posting. Make sure it's good enough!

#### Announcements: Keeping consistency

- All posts are to be written in United States English. Different spellings for different words will occur, so be mindful of spelling. Words included but not limited to are: color, center, skillful, analyze, etc.
- Posts regarding challenges, contests, and Camellia Monthly must follow [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119). It is also encouraged to use [proper markdown](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51) for posts.
- Trademarks must be correctly typed, including games, media, music, etc. Examples include YouTube, Discord, etc.
- Dates must be followed with a specified time (if possible). Dates could be written with [Discord integration](https://r.3v.fi/discord-timestamps) or with HH:MM TIMEZONE. Avoid using GMT; use UTC for ease of use. Date formatting should follow something like this: June 5, 2022 (00:40 UTC-5).

## Compassion

### Crisis handling

> Detailed discussions regarding crisis handling are handled internally and are not disclosed to the public. If staff members wish to engage silently in crisis handling, they must report all concerning messages to Discord.
{: .disclaimer }

*In the event of a member having a crisis, breakdown, or rant in a public space, staff members must provide a list of hotline services to support the member (in DMs or in [#serious-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1080971258272948265)). If a member falls within these conditions, action is required.*

1. The user threatens suicide or self-harm.
1. The user shows concerning behavior in [#serious-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1080971258272948265) or in any channel.
1. A fellow member shows concern regarding the conditions above for their other fellow member.

### Demotions

Staff members cannot be demoted unless a mutual agreement is made or for individual reasons.

If an agreement is reached, the staff member will be honorably discharged. If a disagreement is reached however, a compromise must be considered.

#### Compromises

- Staff members may be moved down the hierachy for a position they are more fitting in.
- An Admin must offer support, lectures, or the staff member must offer a plan for improvement.
- If no improvement is found within three months, the staff member will be dishonorably discharged. We're sorry!

## Roles

> This is unfinished. Stay tuned.
{: .caution }

As a part of the staff team, it's important to note how the promotion process works, from Trial Staff to Probationary Staff to full Moderator. Welcome in, and read on!

After two warning messages, it's guaranteed demotion on the third!

> To submit a staff application, please refer to [this link](https://forms.gle/czoe1Eb843SXanGr8).
{: .tip }

### Role Responsibility

#### Probationary and Trial Roles

- All new staff members will start with the Moderator role and a designated secondary role. These roles are called Trial Staff and Probationary Staff.
- Trial Staff will be given to staff members who would normally be denied in the application process but are given a chance to prove themselves to the Admins. Trial Staff is also used as a learning experience for new staff members!
- Probationary Staff are given to competent individuals who have proven their readiness to join the staff team. This is a way to evaluate performance before fully committing to their role.

#### Community Contributor Role

This role is given to members selected from the Community Contributor Applications. Community Contributors must follow this criteria.

> To submit a Contributor application, please refer to [this link](https://forms.gle/qbtPq3nVck9S2z426).
{: .tip }

- Review server directions and feedback for understanding what the community wants/needs.
- Read and review the [event](#events) section.
- Talk and communicate with server members and work with staff members to create something awesome!

#### General Guidelines for All Staff

- Communicate. Transparency and clarity are key with peers. Collaborate on projects for a cohesive community experience.
- Be professional. Address concerns diplomatically and with a curious mind.
- Document things. Keep notes of actions, decisions, and feedback.

By adhering to the Staff Guidelines, each team member contributes to the success of our community.
