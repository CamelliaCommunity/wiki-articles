The Camellia Discord is a server established on the social media platform Discord to serve as a community where fans of the Japanese EDM artist Camellia can gather together. The server originated in 2018, shortly before Camellia’s album Heart of Android was released. Since then, the server has grown considerably and now hosts announcements for Camellia’s new works, a monthly newsletter, and numerous community-driven events!

## Significant Dates

### 8/25-26/2018

The Camellia server was created. KonekoKitten has made the server, later passing ownership to Camellia himself. The original suggestions channel was created. The server was *semi-private* at the time. Korean and Japanese announcements/channels are made.

### 8/28-29/2018

Microsoft Excel is the biggest inside joke. Microsoft Office becomes a meme. The server reaches the 1000-member milestone. Camellia teases a track preview for server members.

### 9/3-4-5/2018

Microsoft Excel and Windows 95 are still memes. Emote suggestions and requests are being considered. Microsoft Excel emotes were added and are still on the server today.

### 6/3-4/2019

The original suggestions channel was closed due to low-quality suggestions.

### 7/17/2021

The photography channels were closed due to inactivity.
