## I Have Escaped

Since I no longer needed Adobe programs, I wanted to cancel my Creative Cloud Subscription. Of course, Adobe, as excellent as they are, tried to charge me an 80 USD cancellation fee. Awesome right?

I quickly searched for how I could work around this.

### How to bypass the cancellation fee in 2 easy steps

1. Switch to a cheaper plan for one of Adobe's products
1. Cancel the plan immediately afterward

Now, you will be refunded some money, and you won't get hit with a stupidly large cancellation fee. Bravo! 

## Alternatives

Here are some alternatives I know.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - UI/UX Design
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - 3D design, videos?
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - Photoshop Alternative
- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - Photoshop Alternative 
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Photoshop Alternative 
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - Premiere Pro Alternative
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) - Premiere Pro Alternative
- [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) - Premiere Pro Alternative

*This list will be expanded eventually.*

I hate Adobe.
