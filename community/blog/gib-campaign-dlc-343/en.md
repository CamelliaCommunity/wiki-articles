## Seasonal Depression

Halo Infinite launched with the hope that campaign DLC was coming to the game. It did not, in the end. The depression I've felt for this monumental disappointment is immeasurable, and my hopes and dreams for this game are crushed. Campaign DLC potential leaks would've included the Spirit of Fire crew, which would've been a great addition to the story in Halo Infinite. In this author's opinion, there were hopes that this would've been the way forward, as this crew is severely underrated. However, this did not happen, and 343 Industries has been silent on all future prospects of campaign DLC for Halo Infinite. This will not stand. There will be a great fire. That is all.
