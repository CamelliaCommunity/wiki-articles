## What's Rectify 11?

Rectify 11 is a modification for Windows 11 that advertises itself as "Something Windows 11 should've been". It updates some icons from the Windows 8 era and refreshes some Windows 11 UI, allowing for consistency. In Rectify's FAQ, it's known that it also shows itself to work with Windows 10 but is "highly not recommended". I believe that the installer should not run on Windows 10 since installing this modification is highly unrecommended. But since it's supported, I decided to install Rectify 11 on my own machine. The results are mostly okay, but there are still issues that involve text color and themes.

My main concern, however, is Rectify 11's buggy state and its developers. Even on Windows 11, the modification is still buggy, and people do not get the support they need to help fix these bugs. These bugs mostly involve light/dark mode and themes. Support isn't helpful much even for Windows 11 users.

I managed to fix most of the issues not by messing with the Registry editor but by messing with Rectify's "injection" (I uninstalled some things). Now, some things look a lot cleaner, but I still have the folder issue, but that's mainly on Windows 10.

But hey, why did I install it? Mostly because I want to change things up. It looks cool, after all. But I don't recommend installing this on any machine at the moment. Install a debloater script instead.
