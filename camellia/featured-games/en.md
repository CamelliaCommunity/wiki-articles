## Introduction

Many popular artists within Japanese EDM culture are featured in rhythm games due to the strong Japanese rhythm game community and the fast-paced and energetic nature of Japanese EDM, which makes it perfect for such games. Camellia is inarguably prominent among these, having over 56 songs officially featured in numerous rhythm games and countless others used in community-driven games such as osu!.

The journey of Camellia’s discography within rhythm games began in 2014 when his song “Bassdrop Freaks (feat. Nanahira) was given a place in the game Beatmania IIDX. Since then, Camellia has become synonymous with rhythm games, incorporating his work into games such as osu!, Beat Saber, and A Dance of Fire and Ice, among many others. Camellia’s music is considered a staple even within less popular rhythm games when creating levels or “maps.” As of 2024, Camellia’s artistry remains at the forefront of rhythm game communities worldwide.
