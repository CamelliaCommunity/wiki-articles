## What happened?

Mister Elon Musk (CEO of Twitter/X) decided it would be a great idea to ignore Brazilian misinformation laws and thus banned Twitter from the region.

We know there are a number (tons) of Camellia fans within Brazil, because of this I would like to offer alternative platforms on where to follow Camellia.
