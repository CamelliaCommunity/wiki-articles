## Hey all

Merry (late) Christmas and happy (early) New Year! During our [last meeting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cp8ELwVzsRuA7TcM7abMJpqCWSTwtltQ/view?usp=sharing), we have discussed using Ko-fi as a way to donate to the Camellia Discord. This donation page will allow us to fund:

- Events and prizes
- Premium services to ensure server quality
- Miscellaneous items, such as custom domains, other services, and more!

These funds are *strictly* going to be given back to the community. Discussion for staff compensation will come at a later time. If you donate, you are ensuring good server quality, management, and giving us the opportunity to give more back!

Check out our Ko-fi page below!
