THE CAMELLIA DISCORD—Server members are very lucky to have a stable, transparent, and professional staff team looking after them. Nobody would think the staff team is deeply rooted in corruption and bias.

Corruption and bias like this doesn't happen and the staff team is clearly an ethical gift from God.

The staff team are big fans of transparancy and totally would have addressed all of the issues members have brought up in the [#server-direction](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1034240760154947584/1287578974020702259) channel.

"Absolutely nobody thinks anything is wrong, and everyone is comfortable," said a member of the Camellia Discord, which further supports that the staff team is transparent and stable.
