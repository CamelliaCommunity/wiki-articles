## What if it does?
Well, first off, RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". It is meant to show information from a website to users automatically. In theory, this news post would be posted in [#server-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648) in the Camellia Discord.

## Why are you testing this now?
We have some cool things planned! This RSS code is a little old and was *never* tested properly (insane, right?). So, we might as well test it now since we may use it very soon! If this is the first time you've heard that we have an RSS feed for the Wiki, congratulations! This is NEWS to you!!
